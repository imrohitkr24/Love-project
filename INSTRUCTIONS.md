# How to Personalize Your Love Website ❤️

Your website is ready with a magical design! Here is how to make it truly yours:

## 1. Add Your Music 🎵
- Find a romantic song (MP3 format).
- Rename it to `music.mp3`.
- Place it inside the `assets` folder.

## 2. Add Your Photos 📸
- Choose 5 of your best photos.
- Rename them to:
  - `memory1.jpg`
  - `memory2.jpg`
  - `memory3.jpg`
  - `memory4.jpg`
  - `memory5.jpg`
- Place them inside the `assets` folder.
- **Note**: If you do this, I can update the code to use your photos instead of the internet ones. Just let me know!

## 3. Edit the Letter 💌
- Open `script.js`.
- Find the `loveMessage` variable (around line 180).
- Change the text inside the backticks (`) to write your own heartfelt message.

Good luck! She will love it! 💖
